This project implements **AES-256 encryption and decryption** for files.  
It allows users to securely encrypt any file using a secret key and later decrypt it back to its original form.

## Features
- AES-256 file encryption
- AES-256 file decryption
- Key generation for secure encryption
- Easy to use Jupyter Notebook interface

## Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- `cryptography`
- `os`
- `base64`

You can install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install cryptography
